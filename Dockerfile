# This docker file can be used to build a tool chain docker image for building RomWBW images.

# Tested on a ubuntu host and on Windows un WSL (with docker desktop)

# First build the docker image (will b)
# docker build --progress plain -t romwbw-chain .

# After you have built the above image (called romwbw-chain), you can use it to compile and build the RomWBW images
# as per the standard make scripts within RomWBW.
# Start a new terminal, cd to where you have clone RomWBW, and then run this command: 
# docker run -v ${PWD}:/src/ --privileged=true -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -it romwbw-chain

# you can now compile and build the required images:

# cd Tools && make
# cd Source && make # at least once to build many common units
# cd Source && make rom ROM_PLATFORM=RCZ80 ROM_CONFIG=std

# when finish, type 'exit' to return to back to your standard terminal session
